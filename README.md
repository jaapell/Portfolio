# A Data Scientist's Portfolio
Hello and welcome! My name is Jacob Pell, and this is a portfolio of my work for your reference. I am a freelance Data Scientist,  consultant, and mentor looking to improve processes with math! My experience encompases statistical data analysis, reporting solutions, artificial intelligence & machine learning, and end-to-end data science pipeline architecture consultation. My work was used in various United States Congressional committees, scientific publications, and by civil servants making data-based decisions in the field. I pride myself on creating thorough, well-communicated products. Data speaks volumes if you know how to listen, and I will be your guide to extracting insight and implementing its utility through data-driven decision making.
